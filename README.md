(BionicLambda Universal SHell)
A simple shell made in Python. Docs and possible C port incoming.
<br/>
Note: The Linux executables were made on Ubuntu. <br/>
If for some reason the executable is not working, try running `build.sh` on Linux or `build.bat` or Windows.

#### Contributing:
4 space wide tab indents
Use `f''` instead of `.format()`
One space between operators - Ex: `2 + 4` not `2+4`
